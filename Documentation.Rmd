This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
require(RunningStats)

## Import
ddir1 <- "dat/2014-08-14-Running.gpx"
ddir2 <- "dat/2015-02-01-Running.gpx"

Tr1 <- getTr(ddir1)
Tr2 <- getTr(ddir2)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
